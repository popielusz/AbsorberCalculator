# AbsorberCalculator
* A simple app calculating absorber's height and profile using basic system conditions, reading some data from .txt file
* Vanilla C#

# What I learned
* Building basic GUI
* Spliting .txt files
* General object-oriented programming concepts
* MS Visual Studio basic functions 
* Concept of exception handling
* To always check which function is called first :) 

# Things I want to improve
* To add a graph which shows the equilibrium and operating line
Some toolbars (like Help, editing filling list inside the application, loading and saving it)
* Optimize GUI
* Raport generator with simple absorption scheme inside
* Try/Catch rather than an if's
